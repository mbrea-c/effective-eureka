# effective-eureka
An effective blog server that compiles LaTeX posts into static pages. Eureka!

## Purpose
This project was meant as an exploration of whether writing blog posts in LaTeX was feasible, but it soon became evident that
it was a better idea to write in Markdown and compile into a static site.
